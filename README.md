# A simple dynamic programming problem
Takes item names, values and weight from a file, and depending on the knapsack capacity entered it will choose the items with the highest amount of value it can fit in the knapsack, made with **dynamic programming** and therefore will have the right answer in every case.

In Terminal Write:

Filename.txt 123

Replace filename with whatever file the items are in and 123 with whatever weight limit you want
